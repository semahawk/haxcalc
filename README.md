# hc

A handy calculator. Think `bc` but more tailored for low-level operations such as bitshifts, bitwise XORs &c.

## Building

```
cargo build
```

## Usage

```
cargo run
```

This should drop you into the `hc` shell. Sample session:

```
>> 0b1100 | 0x3
res0 = 0000000015 (hex: 0000000f bin: 00000000000000000000000000001111)
>> 1 << 4 | res0
res1 = 0000000031 (hex: 0000001f bin: 00000000000000000000000000011111)
>> res1 + 1 | res1
res2 = 0000000063 (hex: 0000003f bin: 00000000000000000000000000111111)
>> 0'6
res3 = 0000000064 (hex: 00000040 bin: 00000000000000000000000001000000)
>> 0'6'7
res4 = 0000000192 (hex: 000000c0 bin: 00000000000000000000000011000000)
>> 0'6'7.6
res5 = 0000000128 (hex: 00000080 bin: 00000000000000000000000010000000)
>> zeropad = 16
res6 = 00016 (hex: 0010 bin: 0000000000010000)
>> 0'16 - 1
res7 = 65535 (hex: ffff bin: 1111111111111111)
```
